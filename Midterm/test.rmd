## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
fp1<- data.frame(read.csv("fatal-police-shootings-data.csv"))
```

```{r}
fp <- na.omit(fp1) # Method 1 - Remove NA
fp

```


```{r}
nrow(fp)

table(fp$armed)
```

```{r}
str(fp)

mean(fp$age, na.rm= TRUE)
```
```{r}
for (i in fp$name){
  if (i== "Brock Nichols"){
    break}
  else {
    print (i)}
  
} 

str(fp)
```
```{r}
ar <-lm(age~race, data=fp)
summary(ar)
```
