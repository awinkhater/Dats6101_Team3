## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

**Interesting Finding 1 : California has the highest police shootings, and highest suspects shot in California are Hispanic and not White/Black.
We looked at the total deaths in each state by race and following are some of the insights:

1)We see that police has shot the most people in California - a total of 885, followed by Texas with a total of 553 and then Florida with 427 deaths.
2)These results are consistent with the relative population of these states. Highest being California, then Texas  and Florida .
3)We also observe that the highest number of deaths is for Hispanic in California, whereas in Texas and Florida there are more deaths amongst White.

```{r}
#Filtering the data by race and states and summarizing it
police_sr <- police %>%
  filter(!race == "") %>%
  group_by(state, race) %>%
  summarise(deaths = n())
  
#Spreading the data to get deaths by race
spread_sr <- spread(police_sr, race, deaths)

#Getting the total number of deaths per state
spread_sr$Total <- rowSums(spread_sr[,-1], na.rm = TRUE)

#Check the results if needed
# head(spread_sr)

#Data setup for hovering on the map
sr_data <- spread_sr
sr_data$hover <- with(sr_data, paste("Asian", A, '<br>',
                                     "Black",B,'<br>',
                                     "Hispanic",H,'<br>',
                                     "Native American",N,'<br>',

  showlakes = TRUE,
  lakecolor = toRGB('white')
)

        locationmode = 'USA-states', color = spread_sr$Total, colors = 'Reds',
        colorbar = list(title = "Counts ")) %>%
        layout(title = 'Number of people shot dead by race per State<br>(Hover for breakdown by race)', geo = graph)


```
**Interesting Finding 2 - Black people shot were relatively younger compared to other race.
We are looking at the age of the suspect shot vs their race. The observations are as follows:

1)We see from the boxplot below, that the median age for Black that have been shot is 29 years.
2)White have relatively higher median age of 35 years whereas Asian have the highest median age of around 38 years.


```{r}
#Filtering the data by age and race
police %>%
  filter(!is.na(age) & race != '') %>% #Remove blanks and NAs
  
  #Box plots
  ggplot (aes(x=race, y=age)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = race)) +

  #Axes labels and titles
  labs(x = "Suspects' Race", y = "Suspecs' Age", 
       title = "Distribution of Suspects' Age across Race") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c('White',
                            'Other',
                            'Native American',
                            'Hispanic',
                            'Black',
                            'Asian')) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```
**Interesting Finding 3 - Hardly any female death shootings has been observed
We looked at the deaths by race and gender and following are some of the insights:

1)Maximum number of suspects shot were males and there were very few females.
2)Maximum number of suspects shot were White, however this does not necessarily mean that higher proportion of white popultion is shot. These are absolute numbers and they are high as white have a significantly large population compared to other race.


```{r}
#Filtering the data by race and gender
data_by_rg <- police %>%
                      filter(race != "") %>%
                      filter(gender != "") %>%
                        group_by(race, gender) %>%
                         summarize(No_of_deaths = n())

#Plotting Data
ggplot(data_by_rg, aes(x = race, y = No_of_deaths, fill = gender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs (x = 'Race', y = 'Number of deaths') +
  ggtitle('Deaths by race and gender') +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c('Asian',
                            'Black',
                            'Hispanic',
                            'Native American',
                            'Other',
                            'White')) +
  theme_few()


```
**Interesting Finding 4 - Higher % of unarmed Black suspects were shot than any other race
We looked at the distribution of deaths by Race and top 5 armed categories. Following are some key observations:

1)Around ~11% of the Black suspects were unarmed whereas only ~6% of the White suspects were unarmed
Guns are the most popular weapon across all the races except for Asians (Asian suspects have a higher proportion of Knives)



```{r}
# Finding the top 5 arms used by suspects 
top_5_arms <- police %>%
                group_by(armed) %>%
                summarise(num_arms = n()) %>%
                arrange(desc(num_arms)) %>%
                head(5)

#Filtering the data by top 5 arms found
race_armed_data <- police %>%
    filter(race != '') %>%
    mutate(armed_mod = ifelse(armed %in% c('gun', 'knife', 'unarmed', 'vehicle', 'undetermined'), as.character(armed), 'Other')) %>%
    group_by(race, armed_mod) %>%
    summarise(Deaths = n())

# Spreading the data 
race_armed_data_spr <- race_armed_data %>%
    spread(armed_mod, Deaths) 

#Replacing missing values with 0
race_armed_data_spr[is.na(race_armed_data_spr)] <- 0 

print("% distribution of deaths by Armed Category in each Race")


```
```{r}
#Printing the data
summary_table <- cbind(as.data.frame(race_armed_data_spr[,1]), as.data.frame(round(race_armed_data_spr[,-1]/rowSums(race_armed_data_spr[,-1])*100, 2)))

#Renaming the race values
levels(summary_table$race) <- c("", "Asian", "Black", "Hispanic", "Native American", "Other", "White")

#Print the table
print(summary_table)


```
**Graph : For better visualization, plotting the above results from the table in a stacked bar chart below
```{r}
#Plotting the above table in a stacked bar
ggplot(race_armed_data, aes(x = race, y = Deaths, fill = armed_mod)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs (x = 'Race', y = 'Number of deaths') +
  ggtitle('How were suspects/victims armed by Race') +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c('Asian',
                            'Black',
                            'Hispanic',
                            'Native American',
                            'Other',
                            'White')) + 
   theme_few() 



```
Interesting Finding 5 - Higher proportion of Asians were not fleeing but still shot
We looked at the distribution of deaths by suspectsâ€™ race and whether they were trying to flee or not. Following are some of the interesting observations:

1)Only 60% of the Black suspects shot were not fleeing whereas 82% of the Asian suspects who were shot were not trying to flee
2)Car seems to be the most popular method of fleeing among White suspects whereas for Black suspects (15%), most popular method of fleeing was by foot (19%)


```{r}
#Filtering the data and summarizing it  
race_flee_data <- police %>%
    filter(race != '') %>%
    group_by(race, flee) %>%
    summarise(Deaths = n()) %>%
    spread(flee, Deaths) 

#Replacing the missing values with 0
race_flee_data[is.na(race_flee_data)] <- 0 

print("% distribution of deaths by suspects' status (Fleeing or not fleeing) by Race")



```
```{r}
#Printing the table
summary_table <- cbind(as.data.frame(race_flee_data[,1]), as.data.frame(round(race_flee_data[,-1]/rowSums(race_flee_data[,-1])*100, 2)))

#Renaming the race values
levels(summary_table$race) <- c("", "Asian", "Black", "Hispanic", "Native American", "Other", "White")

#Print the table
print(summary_table)
```
**Interesting Pattern 6 - Suprisingly there is seasonaility across year or months in police shootings
We looked into the monthly trend for 12 years and used ARIMA to forecast the crime for next four months. Since, there is seasonality into the police shootings, even the forecast predicts average/high shootings for the next four months with a wide confidence interval.
```{r}
#Summarizing the data at year month level and plotting the trend line
police %>%
   mutate(year_month = format(as.Date(date, '%d-%m-%Y'),"%Y_%m")) %>%
   group_by(year_month) %>%
   summarise(n = n()) %>%
   
   #Plot the line  
   ggplot(aes(x = year_month, y = n, group = 1)) +
   geom_line(color = "blue") +
   geom_point(color = "blue") +

   #Axes labels and titles
   labs(x = "Year and Month of death occurrence",
       y = "Number of deaths",
       title = "Number of deaths Vs. Year and Month of death occurrence") +
   scale_x_discrete(breaks =
     levels(as.factor(format(as.Date(police$date, '%d-%m-%Y'),"%Y_%m")))[c(T, rep(F, 11))]) +
   theme_bw()


```

```{r}
#Number crimes
num_crimes <- police %>%
   mutate(year_month = format(as.Date(date, '%d-%m-%Y'),"%Y_%m")) %>%
   group_by(year_month) %>%
   summarise(n = n()) %>%
   select(n)

#Converting num_crimes in to time series object
crime_ts <- ts(num_crimes)

#Fitting the best arima model
model <- auto.arima(crime_ts, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE)

#Predict next 3 months based on the model created
predict <- model %>% forecast(level = c(95), h = 5)

#Plot the graph
print(predict %>%
       autoplot() +
       labs(x = "Year and Month from  2015 to 2022",
            y = "Number of deaths",
            title = paste0("Death due to police shooting forecast for the next four months")) +
            theme_bw())


```
