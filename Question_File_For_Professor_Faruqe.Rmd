## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
#Calling Packages
library(dplyr)

library(ggplot2)
#RAW SET BELOW 
fp1<- data.frame(read.csv("FPS22.csv"))
```
```{r}
#Cleaning null values from dataset
fp <- na.omit(fp1) 

```

```{r}
#Basics
nrow(fp)
col(fp)
summary(fp)
head(fp)
```
So for this project I would like to take this data and reshape it to be grouped by state, and compare proportions of body_cameras being turned on by state. I would like to do this with a chisq test, but I am having trouble reshaping and grouping the data but maintaining it in a format where the chisq() function works.

Heres how I reshaped the data frame to be grouped by state. I will explain each new variable with a comment above:

```{r}
#This is the raw categorical data of bodycameras being on or off, grouped by state
sfp <- fp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(sbc = body_camera)

#This is a numeric proportion of the body cameras being on by state
sfp <- fp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(stbcp =  sum(body_camera==1)/n())
#This is a numeric proportion of the Men by state
sfp <- sfp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(gen.p =  sum(gender=="M")/n())
#This is a numeric proportion of sings_of_mental_illness by state
sfp <- sfp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(smi.p =  sum(signs_of_mental_illness==TRUE)/n())
#This is a numeric proportion of fleeing victims by state
sfp <- sfp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(flee.p =  sum(flee=="fleeing")/n())
#This is a numeric proportion of attackers by state
sfp <- sfp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(att.p =  sum(threat_level== "attack")/n())
#This is a numeric proportion of armed victims by state
sfp <- sfp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(armed.p =  sum(armed != "unarmed")/n())
#This is a numeric proportion of suspects being shot (as opposed to tasered) by state
sfp <- sfp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(MoD.p =  sum(manner_of_death == "shot")/n())
#This is the average age by state
sfp <- sfp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(age.avg =  sum(age)/n())
#This is variable is for later analysis (maybe for the final) and is the proportion of non-white victims by state
sfp <- sfp %>%
   group_by(state) %>%
   mutate(Non_White_prop =  sum(race != "W")/n())

#This line just drops all non grouped by state data from this version of the dataframe
By_State <- subset(sfp, select= -c(name, id, age, latitude, longitude, city, manner_of_death, gender, armed, race, signs_of_mental_illness, flee, threat_level, body_camera, date, is_geocoding_exact))
```

```{r}
summary(By_State)
```
```{r}
#Here is an example of what I am trying to do
chisq.test(By_State$stbcp)

#I get a p-value of 1

#chisq.test(By_State$sbc) This command wont run, because sbc isnt positive (it is a series of 0's and 1's)

#How would I run a chisq test to see whether or not there is a siginficant difference between the states body camera proportions ?

```
